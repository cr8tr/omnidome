This folder contains a developer SDK and sample applications.

The Spout SDK files can either be included directly in your project or compiled as a dll.
See the SpoutSDK folder for Visual Studio project files .

The Spout applications and examples have been compiled with the SDK files included in
the projects and so are not dependent on a dll.

Compilers other than Visual Studio may not accept the Spout SDK source code which contains
std set and map. If so, you can use a C-compatible dll. See the SpoutSDK\SPOUT_LIBRARY
for more information.

You can check for the latest code on GitHub.
